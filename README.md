# Sovereign Ethics Engine

The Sovereign Ethics Engine is a transparent, auditable, rule‑based ethical decision system designed to evaluate user requests and resolve them according to explicitly defined ethical rules.

The engine evaluates requests and resolves them into one of three outcomes:

• ALLOW  
• CONSTRAIN  
• REFUSE  

It implements the Sovereign Ethics Algebra (SEA) in Python, providing a clear, inspectable, and extensible foundation for sovereign agents, microservices, and institutional workflows.

All reasoning paths are deterministic, inspectable, and governed by documented
extension and anti‑drift rules.

## What This Project Is Not

To avoid ambiguity or misuse, this system is **explicitly not**:

• A universal moral authority  
• An AI alignment solution  
• A probabilistic or opaque classifier  
• A replacement for human judgment  
• A general content moderation framework  

The Sovereign Ethics Engine enforces *explicit ethical rules* within a bounded scope. It does not claim moral omniscience, normative universality, or autonomy beyond its declared logic.
